1) Please read the below case carefully and by using MS Project 2000 (you can find it at B and G Labs) generate a 
GANTT Chart in order to display the relation between the tasks of the case. 
You have to show the major 4 tasks as milestones (we composed a milestone by giving indentation to the sub-tasks as discussed at our lab session) 
and all the sub-tasks that were defined in the case. 
Moreover, assume that there are 3 teams (Team A, Team B & Team C)that were assigned to that project. 
If collaborative work is required to implement this project on time, 
how can you assign them to the tasks so that they will have equal (almost) work load at the end? Finally, 
is it possible to finish that project in 7 months as mentioned on the case? Show the overall duration of the project 
by adding a milestone (with the name ARPA BPM) at the top.
IMPORTANT: Instead of 'days' you have to show 'weeks' under Duration part!

2) Please generate a PERT Analysis in order to prove the duration that you have calculated by MS Project. 
Also, mention the alternative paths by using MS Word (1 page document, you may use Insert/Shapes)
